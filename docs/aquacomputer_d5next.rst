Description
-----------

This driver exposes hardware sensors of listed Aquacomputer devices, which
communicate through proprietary USB HID protocols.

The Aquaero devices expose eight physical, eight virtual and four calculated
virtual temperature sensors, as well as two flow sensors. The fans expose their
speed (in RPM), power, voltage and current. The four fans can also be controlled
directly, as well as configured as DC or PWM using pwm[1-4]_mode. Aquaero 6 supports
PWM for all four fans, while the Aquaero 5 supports it only for the fourth fan.
Temperature offsets can also be controlled.

Additionally, Aquaero devices also expose twenty temperature sensors and twelve flow
sensors from devices connected via Aquabus. The assigned sensor number is
predetermined by the Aquabus address of the device.

For the D5 Next pump, available sensors are pump and fan speed, power, voltage
and current, as well as coolant temperature and eight virtual temp sensors. Also
available through debugfs are the serial number, firmware version and power-on
count. Attaching a fan to it is optional and allows it to be controlled using
temperature curves directly from the pump. If it's not connected, the fan-related
sensors will report zeroes. The pump can be configured either through software or
via its physical interface.

The Octo exposes four physical and sixteen virtual temperature sensors, a flow sensor
as well as eight PWM controllable fans, along with their speed (in RPM), power, voltage
and current. Flow sensor pulses are also available.

The Quadro exposes four physical and sixteen virtual temperature sensors, a flow
sensor and four PWM controllable fans, along with their speed (in RPM), power,
voltage and current. Flow sensor pulses are also available.

The Farbwerk and Farbwerk 360 expose four temperature sensors. Additionally,
sixteen virtual temperature sensors of the Farbwerk 360 are exposed.

The High Flow Next exposes +5V voltages, water quality, conductivity and flow readings.
A temperature sensor can be connected to it, in which case it provides its reading
and an estimation of the dissipated/absorbed power in the liquid cooling loop.

The Leakshield exposes two temperature sensors and coolant pressure (current, min, max and
target readings). It also exposes the estimated reservoir volume and how much of it is
filled with coolant. Pump RPM and flow can be set to enhance on-device calculations.

The Aquastream XT pump exposes temperature readings for the coolant, external sensor
and fan IC. It also exposes pump and fan speeds (in RPM), voltages, as well as pump
current. Pump and fan speed can be controlled using PWM.

The Aquastream Ultimate pump exposes coolant temp and an external temp sensor, along
with speed, power, voltage and current of both the pump and optionally connected fan.
It also exposes pressure and flow speed readings.

The Poweradjust 3 controller exposes an internal and an external temperature
sensor. It also exposes RPM, voltage and current for one fan and a flow meter.

The High Flow USB exposes an internal and external temperature sensor and a flow meter.

The MPS Flow devices expose the same entries as the High Flow USB because they have the
same USB product ID and report sensors equivalently.

Configuring listed devices through this driver is not implemented completely, as
some features include addressable RGB LEDs, for which there is no standard sysfs interface.
Thus, some tasks are better suited for userspace tools.

Depending on the device, not all sysfs and debugfs entries will be available.
Writing to virtual temperature sensors is not currently supported.

Usage notes
-----------

The devices communicate via HID reports. The driver is loaded automatically by
the kernel and supports hotswapping.

PWM control is available on D5 Next, Quadro, Octo and Aquaero.
Configuring fan curves is only available on the D5 Next, Quadro and Octo.
The modes PID control and two point control are not implemented.

Possible pwm_enable values for D5 Next, Quadro and Octo are:

====== ==========================================================
0      Set fan to 100%
1      Direct PWM mode (applies value in corresponding PWM entry)
2      PID control mode
3      Fan curve mode
[4-11] Follow fan[1-8], if available and device supports
====== ==========================================================

Possible pwm_enable values on Aquaero are:

====== ==========================================================
0      Set fan to 100%
1      Direct PWM mode (applies value in corresponding PWM entry)
2      PID control mode
3      Fan curve mode
4      Two point control mode
